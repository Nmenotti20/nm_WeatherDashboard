##### 1. Project Description

Objective

The objective of this project was to create a weather dashboard for a traveler to be able to see the weather outlook for multiple cities in order to use the information to prepare for the journey. On the weather dashboard, there is an input form which enables the user to enter a Destination City and click on the search button and generate a search for the city name entered which would then reach out to the Open Weather API to retrieve weather data for the current day, and a five-day forecast. This search would also save the destination city name searched in a list on the page and store the information in local storage. The API would return the City Name, Date, a weather icon of representing the current weather conditions, current temperature, humidity, windspeed, and UV Index. When the UV Index is viewed, and icon is presented that indicates if the weather conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe. The five-day forecast displays the date, an icon representing the weather conditions, the temperature, and humidity for each day. When a city in the search history is clicked, then that city's current weather and five day forecast information is displayed on the screen. The next time the weather dashboard is opened, the last searched city is displayed with its current conditions, and five day forecast on the screen.
